                                    The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties,
                                    and were named 'retriever' because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged.Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.
                                    They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water.
                                    Golden retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments.They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming.
                                    The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.
                             
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability
                                    assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant.
                                    The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,
                                    the fifth-most popular in Brazil and Australia,and the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom.
                                    Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample (two or more hours a day) exercise.The breed is fond of play but also highly trainable.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The Golden Retriever is a large, strongly built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat.
                                    As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, and owing to its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. 
                                    However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour, and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.

                        <h3 id="t2">British</h3>
                            <p>
                                    British-type Golden Retrievers are prevalent throughout Europe and Australia.
                                    The skull is broader and the forequarters are more muscular than in other types. The muzzle is balanced and well chiseled.
                                    The coat is generally lighter in color than in the American types. 
                                    Males stand between 22 to 24 in (56 to 61 cm) at the withers; females are between 20 to 22 in (51 to 56 cm).
                                    Acceptable or expected weights are not specified in the UK standard, but the Kennel Club standard calls for a level topline and straight hindquarters without the slight rear angulation found in American lines.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The eyes are round and dark, which is in contrast to the triangular or slanted composition of their American counterparts.
                                    British Golden Retrievers can have a coat colour of any shade of gold or cream; red or mahogany are not permitted. 
                                    Originally, cream was an unacceptable colour in the UK standard, but the standard was revised in 1936 to include cream.
                                    At the time of this revision, the exclusion of cream as a colour was agreed to as a mistake, as the original "yellow" retrievers of the 19th century were actually lighter in colour than was permitted by the standards used before 1936.
                                    As with American lines, white is an unacceptable colour in the show ring.
                                    The British Kennel Club standard is used in all countries except the USA and Canada.
                                    Golden retrievers have muscular bodies with great endurance, owing to their origins as hunting and gundogs.

                        <h3 id="t3">Temperament</h3>
                        <p>
                                The temperament of the Golden Retriever is a hallmark of the breed, and is described in the standard as "kindly, friendly and confident".
                                Golden Retrievers make good family pets, particularly as they are patient with children.
                                They are not "one-man dogs" and are generally equally amiable with both strangers and those familiar to them.
                                Their trusting, gentle disposition makes them a poor guard dog.
                                Any form of unprovoked aggression or hostility towards either people, dogs or other animals, whether in the show ring or community, is considered unacceptable in a Golden Retriever and is not in keeping with the character of the breed, nor should a Golden Retriever be unduly timid or nervous.
                                The typical Golden Retriever is calm, naturally intelligent and biddable, and with an exceptional eagerness to please.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Golden Retrievers are also noted for their intelligence.
                                The breed ranks fourth in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs – following the Border Collie, Poodle, and German Shepherd – as one of the brightest dogs ranked by obedience-command trainability.
                                Typical Golden Retrievers are active and fun-loving animals with the exceptionally patient demeanour befitting a dog bred to sit quietly for hours in a hunting blind. 
                                Adult Goldens love to work, and have a keen ability to focus on a given task. 
                                They will work until they collapse, so care should be taken to avoid overworking them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Other characteristics related to their hunting heritage are a size suited for scrambling in and out of boats and an inordinate love for water.
                                Golden Retrievers are exceptionally trainable—due to their intelligence, athleticism and desire to please their handlers—and excel in obedience trials.
                                They are also very competitive in agility and other performance events.
                                Harsh training methods are unnecessary, as Golden Retrievers often respond very well to positive and upbeat training styles.
                                Golden Retrievers are compatible with other dogs, cats, and most livestock.
                                They are particularly valued for their high level of sociability towards people, calmness, and willingness to learn. 
                                Because of this, they are commonly used as guide dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and search and rescue dogs

                            <p>
                                    The average lifespan for a Golden Retriever is about 11 to 12 years.
                                    The breed is susceptible to specific ailments, so pets should be taken to a veterinarian for yearly checkups.
                                      
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Golden Retrievers are known to have genetic disorders and other diseases.
                                    Hip dysplasia is common in the breed; when buying a puppy, the pedigree should be known and be examined by the OFA or by PennHIP for hip disease. 
                                    Obesity is also common in the breed because Golden Retrievers love to eat. 
                                    Puppies should eat about three cups of food a day and adults three to five cups, depending on the food and how active the dog is. 

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Cancer is the breed's biggest killer, causing 61.4% of American Golden deaths according to a 1998 health study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America
                                    The most common is hemangiosarcoma, followed by lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma.
                                    A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%.
                                    Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs.
                                    Eye diseases are also possible in the breed; cataracts are the most common eye disease,
                                    but they can also be afflicted with progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma, distichiasis,
                                    entropion,corneal dystrophy,and retinal dysplasia.

                                The Golden Retriever's eagerness to please has made it a consistent, top performer in the obedience and agility rings. Its excellent swimming ability makes it proficient at dock jumping.
                                A natural retrieving ability means it is also competitive in flyball and field trials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The first three dogs ever to achieve the AKC Obedience Champion title were Golden Retrievers; the first of the three was a female named 'Ch. Moreland's Golden Tonka'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Since Golden Retrievers are so trainable, they are used for many important jobs, such as guide dogs for blind people, drug or bomb sniffing at airports, or helping to rescuing people from earthquakes and other natural disasters.
                                This breed is also used in water rescue/lifesaving, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Labrador Retriever dogs.
