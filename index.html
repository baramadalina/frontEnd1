                            <p>
                                    From precious pomeranians to mangy mutts, all domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) seem to be descended from the Eurasian gray wolf (Canis lupis). 
                                    But what we still don't know is exactly when and where our best friends transformed from predators into partners.
                                    And such knowledge might help solve the long-disputed question of exactly why dogs were the first animal to be domesticated.
                             
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The dog genome (courtesy of a boxer named Tasha) was first decoded in 2005—and even before that researchers had been using genetic tools to track Fido's first home.
                                    Early research pointed toward east Asia as the locus of first taming after the discovery of high genetic diversity and other key markers in dog populations from various villages there.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Some investigators, however, have since pointed out that the genetic search sampled more east Asian village dogs, neglecting similar pups roaming other villages around the globe. 
                                    That's where the Village Dog Genetic Diversity Project at Cornell University comes in.
                                    Starting with a recent genetic analysis of dogs in African villages, the Cornell group hopes ultimately to create a detailed DNA-based map of canine ancestry worldwide, which in turn should fetch a new understanding of the ancient humans who took them in.                                    

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    One part of that new insight appeared earlier this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), in a study that calls into question the assumption of dogs' east Asian origin.
                                    A team led by Adam Boyko, a researcher at Cornell's Carlos D. Bustamante Lab, sampled 318 village dogs in Africa (as well as hundreds of dogs from North America and Europe for comparison) and discovered that the high genetic diversity of canines there resembles that found in east Asia. 
                                    "We found almost without exception they're descended from different ancestral populations," Boyko says of the village dogs sampled in Africa. That means they may have been there just as long as others had been in east Asia.

                            <p>
                                    Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems.
                                    Dogs have been shown to learn by inference. A study with Rico showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. 
                                    He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure.
                                    Dogs have advanced memory skills. 
                                    A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, "Chaser", who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. 
                                    Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands, although a 2018 study on canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are not more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees or cats.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. 
                                    An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.
                                    Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.
                                    Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them.

                        <h3 id="t3">Behaviour</h3>
                        <p>
                                Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli
                                As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans.
                                As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.
                                Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. 
                                These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.
                                In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. 
                                These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. 
                                These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response  and emotional processing.
                                Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.
                                Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.
                                Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem solving ability.

                            <p>Dogs are often called "man's best friend" because they fit in with human life. Man refers to humankind and not just guys (Old English).
                                    Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, guide dogs for blind people, and police dogs.
                                    There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or illegal drugs.
                                    These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually beagles) are sometimes trained for this job.
                                    Dogs have even been sent by Russians into outer space, a few years before any human being.
                                    The first dog sent up was named Laika, but she died within a few hours.
                                    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    A dog is an animal and does not possess the same reasoning skills as a human. Dogs do have emotions, but their emotions are different than those of humans. 
                                    They are simple creatures with instincts, and their emotions lack complex thought process.
                                    They feel joy when they know you are pleased, they feel sad when someone dies.
                                    However, they do not premeditate or plan ahead, and do not dwell in the past or future. They live for whatever is happening at the moment.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    In a recent study conducted by Takefumi Kikusui, an animal behaviorist at Azabu University in Sagamihara, Japan, a group of dogs and their owners were brought together, then each pair was allowed to interact alone in a room for thirty minutes.
                                    The researchers measured both human and canine levels of oxytocin before and after, and found that levels had gone up in cases where dog and owner spent a lot of time making eye contact — 130% in dogs, and an incredible 300% in humans.

                                Wolves, and their dog descendants, likely derived significant benefits from living in human camps—more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.
                                They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.
                                Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.
                                For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.
                                Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                It has been suggested that the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt.
                                The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The cohabitation of dogs and humans likely improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Human emigrants from Siberia that came across the Bering land bridge into North America likely had dogs in their company.
                                Although one writer  even suggests that the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago,
                                the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,400 years ago.
                                Dogs were an important part of life for the Athabascan population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal.
                                Dogs as pack animals may have contributed migration of the Apache and Navajo tribes 1,400 years ago. 
                                This use of dogs in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to North America.
